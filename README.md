The app integrates with Firebase Firestore to implement CRUD operations for each data collection:
1. **WorkTodos**: Supports Create, Read, Update (completion status), and Delete for work-related tasks.
2. **LifeTodos**: Supports Create, Read, Update (completion status), and Delete for personal tasks.
3. **MoodEntries**: Supports Create, Read, and Delete for mood entries with journalingï¼Œ photo taken, and location marking functionalities.
