# NUWellness App

## Overview
This React Native app helps users manage their to-do lists for work and personal life, track their mood entries, and access tools for mental well-being. The app integrates with Firebase Firestore for data storage and provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to allow users to add, complete, and delete tasks, as well as track mood entries.

## Features
- Work and Life To-Do lists with toggle for task completion
- Mood tracking with journal entries
- Tools section for mental wellness:
  - **Mood Tracker**: Records mood and journal entries.
  - **Challenging Negative Thoughts**: Prompts to help users manage negative thoughts.
  - **Meditation**: Provides quick meditation techniques.
  - **Self-Assessment**: Offers tools for self-assessment, such as PHQ-9 for depression and GAD-7 for anxiety.
- Firebase Firestore integration for persistent data storage

## Components and Structure
The app is structured with React Navigation to handle screen transitions between the main pages:
- **LoginScreen**: Handles autentication,
- **HomeScreen**: Displays quick views for navigating to key functionalities like Work and Life To-Do lists, Mood Tracker, and other tools.
- **WorkScreen**: Manages the to-do list for work-related tasks.
- **LifeScreen**: Manages the to-do list for personal life tasks.
- **ToolsScreen**: Contains access to all the tools listed above for mental well-being.
  - **MoodTrackerScreen**: Allows users to record and view their mood entries along with a journal, a photo, and a location. A daily reminder(notification) is also implemented.
    - **Take Photo**: Direct to the camera with asking permission
    - **Edit Wellness Locations**: Direct to a local map with different kinds of markers. OpenStreetMap API used. 
  - **ChallengingNegativeThoughtsScreen**: Helps users analyze and manage their thoughts with guided questions.
  - **MeditationScreen**: Provides simple meditation exercises with a daily reminder(notification).
  - **SelfAssessmentScreen**: Allows users to take self-assessment questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7).
  
### Navigation
The app uses two main navigators:
- **Tab Navigator** for the bottom navigation bar, containing Home, Tools, and Activities.
- **Stack Navigators** for deeper navigation within each section, enabling users to drill down into specific screens (e.g., viewing the Work and Life To-Do lists from Activities or exploring tools from ToolsScreen).

### CRUD Operations
The app integrates with Firebase Firestore to implement CRUD operations for each data collection:
1. **WorkTodos**: Supports Create, Read, Update (completion status), and Delete for work-related tasks.
2. **LifeTodos**: Supports Create, Read, Update (completion status), and Delete for personal tasks.
3. **MoodEntries**: Supports Create, Read, and Delete for mood entries with journalingï¼Œ photo taken, and location marking functionalities.
